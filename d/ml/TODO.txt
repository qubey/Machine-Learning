Transforms:
- make a ModelTransform class which will run a model as a transform for the final model
- make it so that the saved transforms will read their input and output indices from the config and not be re-sorted by the topological sort (this ensures that the saved models don't have to worry about the column definitions changing)

1. Naive Bayes
2. LDA
3. Linear regression (MLE, ridge, bayesian)
4. Logistic regression
5. decision trees
6. Boosting

Fuck:
1. Implement bucketing algorithm
2. add names for transformed feature values
3. make tool for auto-filtering shitty examples (rule-based)
